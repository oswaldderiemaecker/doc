![GitLab](/assets/2015-12-14/gitlab.png)

We are very pleased to announce that continuousphp now support GitLab repository. 

<!--more-->

GitLab is a well-known repository hosting platform. We had many users who asked for its integration with continuousphp. So [here](/projects/) it is! 

If you are already logged in with a different repository provider, and want to use GitLab, logout and login again.
